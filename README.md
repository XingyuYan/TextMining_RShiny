# TextMining_RShiny
This is the final project for STA 523 (Statistical Programming) at Duke University. We applied our knowledge of text mining, ggplot, shiny app, and machine learning clustering algorithms.
We built a user-interactive Shiny app allowing users to upload text files and get results of word frequency, wordcloud, relationships between words and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. 
The whole project was bulit up on 3 parts: text mining; visualization; shiny.
